## Hi there, I'm Matthew 👋

---

### Current sophomore @ Wright State University (CS & CEG)

Projects I plan on working on this semester

- Machine learning in Rust
    -
    Implementing a basic neural network capable of pattern recognition and generation

    Project will be completed by following [tsoding's](https://github.com/tsoding) machine learning in c [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGSba51aRYU&list=PLpM-Dvs8t0VZPZKggcql-MmjaBdZKeDMw) and implementing in Rust
- Transistor level implementation of the microprocessor I built for CEG3320 (Digital System Design)
    -
    - Microprocessor circuit pictures TBA
    
    (Project will slowly be done as I learn the skills necessary in VLSI)

    Converting high-level gate design into low-level optimized transistor design
